# Wibesoft Case Project

This project was made to showcase building placement and farming mechanics. The project does not use any third party frameworks. Singleton, factory and observer patterns are used for effective and more readable scripting.

For building; The player needs to click inventory button, which will list available buildings. Then by swiping the desired building icon, the player can select which tile on the grid it will be placed. If the tile is not available, then the building will be red and the placement will not occur.
For farming; When the player places the farm plot on the grid, they can click on it to see available seeds to plant. With similar mechanics to building, they can swipe icon and plant the seeds. If clicked plot already has a seed, then harvesting option will be shown. Which only works if plant's harvest timer is up.
